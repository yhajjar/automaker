Automaker is an autonomous AI development studio that transforms how you build software. Instead of manually writing every line of code, you describe features on a Kanban board and watch as AI agents powered by Claude Agent SDK automatically implement them. Built with React, Vite, Electron, and Express, Automaker provides a complete workflow for managing AI agents through a desktop application (or web browser), with features like real-time streaming, git worktree isolation, plan approval, and multi-agent task execution.

## What Makes Automaker Different?

Traditional development tools help you write code. Automaker helps you **orchestrate AI agents** to build entire features autonomously. Think of it as having a team of AI developers working for you—you define what needs to be built, and Automaker handles the implementation.

### The Workflow

1. **Add Features** - Describe features you want built (with text, images, or screenshots)
2. **Move to "In Progress"** - Automaker automatically assigns an AI agent to implement the feature
3. **Watch It Build** - See real-time progress as the agent writes code, runs tests, and makes changes
4. **Review & Verify** - Review the changes, run tests, and approve when ready
5. **Ship Faster** - Build entire applications in days, not weeks

### Powered by Claude Agent SDK

Automaker leverages the [Claude Agent SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk) to give AI agents full access to your codebase. Agents can read files, write code, execute commands, run tests, and make git commits—all while working in isolated git worktrees to keep your main branch safe. The SDK provides autonomous AI agents that can use tools, make decisions, and complete complex multi-step tasks without constant human intervention.

### Why This Matters

The future of software development is **agentic coding**—where developers become architects directing AI agents rather than manual coders. Automaker puts this future in your hands today, letting you experience what it's like to build software 10x faster with AI agents handling the implementation while you focus on architecture and business logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (tested with Node.js 22)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Authentication** (choose one):
  - **[Claude Code CLI](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview)** (recommended) - Install and authenticate, credentials used automatically
  - **Anthropic API Key** - Direct API key for Claude Agent SDK ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AutoMaker-Org/automaker.git
cd automaker

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Build shared packages (can be skipped - npm run dev does it automatically)
npm run build:packages

# 4. Start Automaker
npm run dev
# Choose between:
#   1. Web Application (browser at localhost:3007)
#   2. Desktop Application (Electron - recommended)
```

**Authentication Setup:** On first run, Automaker will automatically show a setup wizard where you can configure authentication. You can choose to:

- Use **Claude Code CLI** (recommended) - Automaker will detect your CLI credentials automatically
- Enter an **API key** directly in the wizard

If you prefer to set up authentication before running (e.g., for headless deployments or CI/CD), you can set it manually:

```bash
# Option A: Environment variable
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Option B: Create .env file in project root
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-..." > .env
```

**For Development:** `npm run dev` starts the development server with Vite live reload and hot module replacement for fast refresh and instant updates as you make changes.

## How to Run

### Development Mode

Start Automaker in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will prompt you to choose your run mode, or you can specify a mode directly:

#### Electron Desktop App (Recommended)

```bash
# Standard development mode
npm run dev:electron

# With DevTools open automatically
npm run dev:electron:debug

# For WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
npm run dev:electron:wsl

# For WSL with GPU acceleration
npm run dev:electron:wsl:gpu
```

#### Web Browser Mode

```bash
# Run in web browser (http://localhost:3007)
npm run dev:web
```

### Building for Production

#### Web Application

```bash
# Build for web deployment (uses Vite)
npm run build
```

#### Desktop Application

```bash
# Build for current platform (macOS/Windows/Linux)
npm run build:electron

# Platform-specific builds
npm run build:electron:mac     # macOS (DMG + ZIP, x64 + arm64)
npm run build:electron:win     # Windows (NSIS installer, x64)
npm run build:electron:linux   # Linux (AppImage + DEB, x64)

# Output directory: apps/ui/release/
```

#### Docker Deployment

Docker provides the most secure way to run Automaker by isolating it from your host filesystem.

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Access UI at http://localhost:3007
# API at http://localhost:3008

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop containers
docker-compose down
```

##### Coolify Deployment

Use the preconfigured Docker Compose file for Coolify:

```bash
# In Coolify, select this file for the Docker Compose source
docker-compose.coolify.yml
```

Then set these environment variables in Coolify:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `VITE_SERVER_URL` (public API URL)
- `CORS_ORIGIN` (public UI URL)

Full guide: [Coolify Deployment](./docs/coolify.md)

##### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root if using API key authentication:

```bash
# Optional: Anthropic API key (not needed if using Claude CLI authentication)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

**Note:** Most users authenticate via Claude CLI instead of API keys. See [Claude CLI Authentication](#claude-cli-authentication-optional) below.

##### Working with Projects (Host Directory Access)

By default, the container is isolated from your host filesystem. To work on projects from your host machine, create a `docker-compose.override.yml` file (gitignored):

```yaml
services:
  server:
    volumes:
      # Mount your project directories
      - /path/to/your/project:/projects/your-project
```

##### Claude CLI Authentication (Optional)

To use Claude Code CLI authentication instead of an API key, mount your Claude CLI config directory:

```yaml
services:
  server:
    volumes:
      # Linux/macOS
      - ~/.claude:/home/automaker/.claude
      # Windows
      - C:/Users/YourName/.claude:/home/automaker/.claude
```

**Note:** The Claude CLI config must be writable (do not use `:ro` flag) as the CLI writes debug files.

##### GitHub CLI Authentication (For Git Push/PR Operations)

To enable git push and GitHub CLI operations inside the container:

```yaml
services:
  server:
    volumes:
      # Mount GitHub CLI config
      # Linux/macOS
      - ~/.config/gh:/home/automaker/.config/gh
      # Windows
      - 'C:/Users/YourName/AppData/Roaming/GitHub CLI:/home/automaker/.config/gh'

      # Mount git config for user identity (name, email)
      - ~/.gitconfig:/home/automaker/.gitconfig:ro
    environment:
      # GitHub token (required on Windows where tokens are in Credential Manager)
      # Get your token with: gh auth token
      - GH_TOKEN=${GH_TOKEN}
```

Then add `GH_TOKEN` to your `.env` file:

```bash
GH_TOKEN=gho_your_github_token_here
```

##### Complete docker-compose.override.yml Example

```yaml
services:
  server:
    volumes:
      # Your projects
      - /path/to/project1:/projects/project1
      - /path/to/project2:/projects/project2

      # Authentication configs
      - ~/.claude:/home/automaker/.claude
      - ~/.config/gh:/home/automaker/.config/gh
      - ~/.gitconfig:/home/automaker/.gitconfig:ro
    environment:
      - GH_TOKEN=${GH_TOKEN}
```

##### Architecture Support

The Docker image supports both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures. The GitHub CLI and Claude CLI are automatically downloaded for the correct architecture during build.

### Testing

#### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

```bash
npm run test            # Headless E2E tests
npm run test:headed     # Browser visible E2E tests
```

#### Unit Tests (Vitest)

```bash
npm run test:server              # Server unit tests
npm run test:server:coverage     # Server tests with coverage
npm run test:packages            # All shared package tests
npm run test:all                 # Packages + server tests
```

#### Test Configuration

- E2E tests run on ports 3007 (UI) and 3008 (server)
- Automatically starts test servers before running
- Uses Chromium browser via Playwright
- Mock agent mode available in CI with `AUTOMAKER_MOCK_AGENT=true`

### Linting

```bash
# Run ESLint
npm run lint
```

### Environment Configuration

#### Authentication (if not using Claude Code CLI)

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Your Anthropic API key for Claude Agent SDK (not needed if using Claude Code CLI)

#### Optional - Server

- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3008)
- `DATA_DIR` - Data storage directory (default: ./data)
- `ENABLE_REQUEST_LOGGING` - HTTP request logging (default: true)

#### Optional - Security

- `AUTOMAKER_API_KEY` - Optional API authentication for the server
- `ALLOWED_ROOT_DIRECTORY` - Restrict file operations to specific directory
- `CORS_ORIGIN` - CORS policy (default: \*)

#### Example .env (web deployment)

```env
# Public URLs
SERVICE_URL_UI=https://automaker.example.com
SERVICE_URL_SERVER=https://automaker-srv.example.com

# Server CORS (must match your UI URL)
CORS_ORIGIN=https://automaker.example.com

# Optional server auth
AUTOMAKER_API_KEY=your-generated-api-key
```

#### Optional - Development

- `VITE_SKIP_ELECTRON` - Skip Electron in dev mode
- `OPEN_DEVTOOLS` - Auto-open DevTools in Electron

### Authentication Setup

#### Option 1: Claude Code CLI (Recommended)

Install and authenticate the Claude Code CLI following the [official quickstart guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart).

Once authenticated, Automaker will automatically detect and use your CLI credentials. No additional configuration needed!

#### Option 2: Direct API Key

If you prefer not to use the CLI, you can provide an Anthropic API key directly using one of these methods:

##### 2a. Shell Configuration

Add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

Then restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `source ~/.zshrc`).

##### 2b. .env File

Create a `.env` file in the project root (gitignored):

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
PORT=3008
DATA_DIR=./data
```

##### 2c. In-App Storage

The application can store your API key securely in the settings UI. The key is persisted in the `DATA_DIR` directory.

- **Navigation:** `K` (Board), `A` (Agent), `D` (Spec), `C` (Context), `S` (Settings), `M` (Profiles), `T` (Terminal)
- **UI:** `` ` `` (Toggle sidebar)
- **Actions:** `N` (New item in current view), `G` (Start next features), `O` (Open project), `P` (Project picker)
- **Projects:** `Q`/`E` (Cycle previous/next project)

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

Automaker is built as an npm workspace monorepo with two main applications and seven shared packages:

```text
automaker/
├── apps/
│   ├── ui/          # React + Vite + Electron frontend
│   └── server/      # Express + WebSocket backend
└── libs/            # Shared packages
    ├── types/                  # Core TypeScript definitions
    ├── utils/                  # Logging, errors, utilities
    ├── prompts/                # AI prompt templates
    ├── platform/               # Path management, security
    ├── model-resolver/         # Claude model aliasing
    ├── dependency-resolver/    # Feature dependency ordering
    └── git-utils/              # Git operations & worktree management
```

### How It Works

1. **Feature Definition** - Users create feature cards on the Kanban board with descriptions, images, and configuration
2. **Git Worktree Creation** - When a feature starts, a git worktree is created for isolated development
3. **Agent Execution** - Claude Agent SDK executes in the worktree with full file system and command access
4. **Real-time Streaming** - Agent output streams via WebSocket to the frontend for live monitoring
5. **Plan Approval** (optional) - For spec/full planning modes, agents generate plans that require user approval
6. **Multi-Agent Tasks** (spec mode) - Each task in the spec gets a dedicated agent for focused implementation
7. **Verification** - Features move to "Waiting Approval" where changes can be reviewed via git diff
8. **Integration** - After approval, changes can be committed and PRs created from the worktree

### Key Architectural Patterns

- **Event-Driven Architecture** - All server operations emit events that stream to the frontend
- **Provider Pattern** - Extensible AI provider system (currently Claude, designed for future providers)
- **Service-Oriented Backend** - Modular services for agent management, features, terminals, settings
- **State Management** - Zustand with persistence for frontend state across restarts
- **File-Based Storage** - No database; features stored as JSON files in `.automaker/` directory

### Security & Isolation

- **Git Worktrees** - Each feature executes in an isolated git worktree, protecting your main branch
- **Path Sandboxing** - Optional `ALLOWED_ROOT_DIRECTORY` restricts file access
- **Docker Isolation** - Recommended deployment uses Docker with no host filesystem access
- **Plan Approval** - Optional plan review before implementation prevents unwanted changes

### Data Storage

Automaker uses a file-based storage system (no database required):

#### Per-Project Data

Stored in `{projectPath}/.automaker/`:

```text
.automaker/
├── features/              # Feature JSON files and images
│   └── {featureId}/
│       ├── feature.json   # Feature metadata
│       ├── agent-output.md # AI agent output log
│       └── images/        # Attached images
├── context/               # Context files for AI agents
├── settings.json          # Project-specific settings
├── spec.md               # Project specification
├── analysis.json         # Project structure analysis
└── feature-suggestions.json # AI-generated suggestions
```

#### Global Data

Stored in `DATA_DIR` (default `./data`):

```text
data/
├── settings.json          # Global settings, profiles, shortcuts
├── credentials.json       # API keys (encrypted)
├── sessions-metadata.json # Chat session metadata
└── agent-sessions/        # Conversation histories
    └── {sessionId}.json
```
